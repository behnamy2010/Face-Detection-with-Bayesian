Face Detection with Bayesian Decision Theory
So far you have probably got familiar enough with the Bayesian Decision Theory to know what to expect from it. If the decision problem is posed in probabilistic terms and all relevant probability values are known, BDT allows to take optimal decisions that minimise errors by choosing the least risky class. Although in many practical classification problems, these conditions are not fulfilled and therefore BDT wonâ€™t be effective, there are still some applications where it may come in handy. Face Detection (not to be mistaken with Face Recognition) is the process of identifying and locating human faces in digital images and videos. It is often the first step in many face-related machine vision applications such as face recognition, emotion detection, gender detection, etc. Now we are going to find out how BDT deals with this problem in practice
